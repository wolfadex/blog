It occurred to me last night that I've been building websites, either professionally or as a hobby, for over 20 years now! I built my first website in a computer class in the 6th grade using nothing more than a text editor and trial & error. Things have come a long ways since then.

In college I learned <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Macromedia</a> Dreamweaver and Macromedia Flash. My first software job was all about <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> and <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a>. Now when I mention most of those things I get looks of confusion.

Everyone seems to be caught up in the rat race of popularity and fandom. Who has the most GitHub stars? What did _insert popular developer_ tweet that they like or dislike? I like to think that I'm above these behaviors, but I know I fall for the same trappings as everyone else.

Given all that, I think it'd be prudent of me to take a step back and assess why I use the tools I do and why I don't use the other tools available to me. Hopefully I'll learn something along the way.
