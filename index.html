          <h3>20 Years of Web</h3>
          <span><small>2020 March 25th</small></span>
          <p>
            It ocurred to me last night that I've been building websites, either
            professionally or as a hobby, for over 20 years now! I built my
            first website in a computer class in the 6th grade using nothing
            more than a text editor and trial & error. Things have come a long
            ways since then. In college I learned
            <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html"
              >Macromedia</a
            >
            Dreamweaver and Macromedia Flash. My first software job was all
            about <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> and
            <a href="https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a>. Now when
            I mention most of those things I get looks of confusion. Everyone
            seems to be caught up in the rat race of popularity and fandom. Who
            has the most GitHub stars? What did
            <em>insert popular twitter user</em> tweet they like or dislike? I
            like to think that I'm above these behaviors, but I'm human too and
            fall for the same trappings as everyone else.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given all that, I think it'd be prudent of me to take a step back
            and assess why I use the tools I do and why I don't use the other
            tools available to me. Hopefully I'll learn something along the way.
